# Copy Zones into a Table
This is useful on documents where text is handwritten into a grid on the page. You need to use the Advanced Zone Locator to read the cells of the table, but you want the results put into a table locator.  
The subfields in the Advanced Zone Locator need to be of the form **SF_R05C25** (for row 5, column 25).  

This script customizes the Table Locator, so that you can use the **Test** button in the Locator to test it.
* Make an Advanced Zone Locator called **AZL**
* Give it Zones called **R01C01**, etc.
* Make a Table Locator called **TL**
* Give the Table Locator a table model that matches the "Columns" in the AZL.
* Copy the Script into the Class Script
* Test the AZL.
* Test the Table Locator. *If you don't **directly** test the Table Locator after the AZL, the designer may "forget" the AZL results.*

*Note: Both the Table Locator and the Advanced Zone Locator store their results within Alternatives(0)*
