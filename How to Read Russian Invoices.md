# How to Read Russian Invoices
Russian invoice have some unique components, that are different from a typical European or American invoice.
* INN and KPP Numbers for both vendor and customer.
* very wide tables  for line items that have between 11 and 15 columns. These columns are very regular and well defined. The last row of the table header contains the column number.

* The table total and tax information is embedded inside the lat row of the table
* Russian invoices can use **-** as a decimal separator and **=** as a negative sign. eg "=101-00" = "-100.00"

## How to read Russian Tables.
Russian Table headers have lots of words with considerable word wrapping. This is a challenge to the table locator.
The following script detects accuractely the Table header. It uses fuzzy logic to avoid OCR errors.
1. Detect the textline containing ""1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12" using fuzzy logic
1. Assign the columns based on the words above the columns, using fuzzy logic.
1. Detect the end of table with a dictionary fuzzily looking for *всего к оплате* (Total Payable) and it's variants.
1. Cluster textlines within the table into table rows to deal with line wrapping.
1. Insert all words in the table into the correct cells
1. Repair OCR errors in numbers using the mathematical relationships
  * **Quantity** * **Unit Price** = **Net Price** (q*u=n)
  * **Net** * **TaxRate** = **TaxAmount** (n*r=x)
  * **Net** + **TaxAmount** = **Total** (n+x=t)
  if one amount is has an OCR error then it can be reconstructed using the above three rules  
  
| q | u | n | r | x | t |              |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | -----------  |
| * | * | * |   |   |   | q*u=n        |
|   |   | * |   | * | * | n+x=t        |
| * | * |   |   | * | * | q*u+x=t      |
| * | * |   | * |   |   | q\*u*(1+r)=t  |
|   |   | * | * |   | * | n*(1+r)=t    |
|   |   |   | * | * | * | x(1+1/r)=t   |
