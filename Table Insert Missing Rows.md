# Insert Missing Rows into a Table

This script searches through the textlines within the table and if any are missing, it inserts a new row at the correct position and copies ALL the words in the textline into the table row.  
It uses the column left & width on that particular page to insert the words.  
This script is best called in the Document Event **Document_AfterLocate**.
Add the script to the document class containing the Table Locator.
```vb
Public Sub Table_InsertMissingRows(LocatorName As String,pXDoc As CscXDocument)
   'This script finds textlines that were skipped in the table locator and inserts them
   'This does NOT insert rows at the beginning of the table, nor after the end of the table
   Dim Table As CscXDocTable, Row As CscXDocTableRow, T As Long
   Set Table=pXDoc.Locators.ItemByName(LocatorName).Alternatives(0).Table
   Set Row=Table.Rows(0)
   'Loop through all the textlines that are in the table.
   For T=Table.Rows(0).TextlineIndexStart To Table.Rows(Table.Rows.Count-1).TextlineIndexEnd
      If Row.IndexInTable=Table.Rows.Count-1 Then Exit For ' we reached the end of the table.
      If T<Row.TextlineIndexStart Then
         'this textline is missing from the table so insert a new Table Row
         Set Row=Table.Rows.Insert(Row.IndexInTable)
         TableRow_InsertWords(pXDoc.TextLines(T).Words,Table,Row)
      End If
      Set Row=Table.Rows(Row.IndexInTable+1)
   Next
End Sub

   Dim W As Long, Word As CscXDocWord, C As Long, Column As New CscXDocField
   For W=0 To Words.Count-1
      Set Word=Words(W)

         Column.Width=Table.Columns(C).Width(Column.PageIndex)
         If Object_OverlapHorizontal(Word,Column)>0 Then
            Row.Cells(C).AddWordData(Word)
            Exit For
         End If
      Next
   Next
End Sub
