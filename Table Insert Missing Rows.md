# Insert Missing Rows into a Table

This script contains two Subroutines  
* **Table_InsertMissingRows**  
searches through the textlines within the table and if any are missing, it inserts a new row at the correct position and copies ALL the words in the textline into the table row.  
* **Table_InsertMissingWords**  
searches through table rows for words that are missing from the table and inserts them.   

It uses the column left & width on that particular page to insert the words.  
These scripts are best called in the Document Event **Document_AfterLocate**.  
Add the script to the document class containing the Table Locator.
```vb
Private Sub Document_AfterLocate(ByVal pXDoc As CASCADELib.CscXDocument, ByVal LocatorName As String)
   Select Case LocatorName
   Case "TL"
      Table_InsertMissingRows(LocatorName,pXDoc)
      Table_InsertMissingWords(LocatorName,pXDoc)
   End Select
End Sub
