# Table Extraction By Regex
Extracting tables via regex is simple and effective if the following are true.
* All of the documents have the same table columns in the same order
* All of the table cells are compulsory. Optional cells will result in following cells shifted to the left
* The OCR quality is excellent. If there are OCR errors that break the regex pattern, then those rows will be omitted

## Configuration
1. Add a Format Locator to your project that finds all table rows.
1. Add a Table Model to your project.
2. Add a Table Locator to your class.
3. Add the Table Model to the Table Locator.
4. Set the Table Locator to "Manual" and make sure it has no other settings. This is to effectively disable the table locator, since you will customize it.

6. Add a Table field and associate the field to the table locator
7. Determine your Regex Pattern to match all cells in the row.
   * **([\d\,\.]+)\s+(.*?)\s+([\d\,\.\-]+)\s+([\d\,\.\-]+)\s+([\d\,\.\-]+)\s+([\d\,\.\-]+)** matches number, text, number, number, number
   * The round brackets () match each cell. The example above is looking for numeric, text, numeric, numeric, numeric cells.
   * **[\d\,\.\-]+** matches numbers containing 0-9,.-. (Note that OCR engines easily mix up "." and "," so the regex is not so strict about order).
   * **\s+** matches space(s) between the cells. There should only be one space between words in KT, but sometimes PDFs do very wierd things and have multiple spaces and/or tabs, that OCR engines do not do.
   * **(.\*?)** is a [non-greedy](https://www.rexegg.com/regex-quantifiers.html) match for anything - this is useful to match a text description when all the other cells are numeric.
8. Add the script below to the Class script. The script does the following
  * Uses the script event **Document_AfterLocate** to run **Table_AddRowsFromAlternatives** after the Text Locator has run.
  * Deletes any table rows that might exist (**Table.Rows.Clear**)
  * Loops through the alternatives of the format locator.
    * Check if the alternative matches the regex.
    * If it matches then add a new table row
    * Add all the words of the text line to the correct cell in the row (by word counting) using the method **AddWordData**, which not only adds text to the cells, it also adds word coordinates, which update the cell, row and table coordinates.
10. You will need to add references to **Kofax Cascade Table Locator** and **Microsoft VB Regular Expressions 5.5** in **Script Menu/Edit/References...**
