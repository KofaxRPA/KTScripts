# Column Locator
This locator finds all the text columns on a document and returns each column as an alternative in the locator.  
The alternatives can then be used to extract paragraphs, to classify by paragraph or column, or to run NLP over columns or paragraphs.  
Add this script to the class containing a script locator with the name **SL_Column**
